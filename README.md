# Motor Control Python
A motor control library for Python currently supporting one motor with more to be added in the future
This was originally created to control motors for my computer science project but should be useful in multiple applications
Also can I say this is my first project on Github and I am still at school so please understand if anything is not quite up to scratch
## Installation
Installed through pip install MotorControlPython

## Usage
once downloaded import through 'from MotorControl import Motor'

## Release Notes

## Plans
Add motors
Add performance profiling to allow more accurate performance on different devices

## Credits
Thanks to Matt at https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/ for the motor control script that got this project started
